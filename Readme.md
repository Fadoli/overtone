strategy game developed by The Logic Factory and released in 1997.

Getting the Game Resources
--------------------------
Overtone will reuse the original resources as much as possible. To run the game,
the user will have to provide the resources (it is unlikely we'll ever be able
to provide these resources ourselves).

The game is considered [abandonware][wikipedia.avandonware], so feel free to
download the game from [My Abandonware][myabandonware.the-tone-rebellion].
